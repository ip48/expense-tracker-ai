Please review the following feature/component for code quality and adherence to project principles: $ARGUMENTS

## Review Process

1. **Locate and read the code**
   - Find the main file(s) for: $ARGUMENTS
   - Read related files (types, utilities, tests) as needed

2. **Check against CLAUDE.md philosophy**
   - Is this too complex? Could it be simpler?
   - Should we use an established library instead of custom code?
   - Does it respect demo constraints (client-side only, LocalStorage)?

3. **Review code quality**
   - Bugs and edge cases
   - React/TypeScript best practices
   - Performance issues
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Accessibility concerns

4. **Provide honest feedback**
   - ✅ What's done well
   - ⚠️ Issues found (critical/moderate/minor)
   - 💡 Specific suggestions with code examples
   - Overall assessment and priority fixes

Be direct and honest - don't just agree if you see issues.
